# Mod Playground

### Minecraft Mod Playground Script - Created by CosmicThing2
### Latest download: [MPG.exe](https://github.com/CosmicThing2/Mod-Playground/raw/master/Install/MPG.exe)

## Install

If running it for the first time, download and extract the zip and then run 'Minecraft Mod Playground.exe'. Do not delete or move it/the other files as these are needed for installation. On first launching a game, you will need to setup MultiMC, choose your RAM, Java installation and enter your account details. You may then need to reload the Mod Playground.

If updating, simply overwrite 'Minecraft Mod Playground.exe'.

## Introduction

Mod Playground effectively functions as a Mod and Map Manager for Minecraft that works alongside MultiMC. It's primarily designed for children and those who aren't so familiar with downloading and installing Minecraft mods. It provides a number of useful features to work via a LAN configuration but can also be used at home.

Mod Playground provides the following features:
- Over 100 of the most popular Minecraft mods already setup in 4 different categories which can be added to Minecraft in one click. Each mod has a short description, picture and a YouTube link to a Mod Spotlight (if one exists!)
- Mod Updater that can update all your mods to their latest versions (via CurseForge)
- Save and load your mod lists. These can either be send to friends online, or if on the same LAN you can simply enter a username to load a mod list instantly from that player
- Custom Mods and Maps. Any custom mods and maps can be added to the launcher via adding them into 'CustomMods.txt' and 'CustomMaps.txt'. Any custom mods can also be updated so long as they exist on CurseForge.
- Random Mods button. Because why not.

For school (or other LANs) environments, the following features are also provided:
- Users can be automatically registered/logged when they start Mod Playground. The username, time and computer are logged to an ini file allowing you to see who's attended/launched the program.
- Prevent users launching the program at certain times. Mod Playground can be locked to a start and end time, a password will be asked otherwise (which is setup by the original administrator).
- Backup Manager which can copy a users' worlds up to a server or shared directory. These worlds are then automatically downloaded when the student uses a different computer, allowing them to keep their worlds whichever computer they use.

## Basic Requirements

For Mod Playground to work, you MUST have:
- MultiMC. This is provided in the download and the launcher can automatically install it for you. In a LAN environment, this would have to be copied/deployed to all PCs that are going to play the game.
- Java. Minecraft (and any mods) require Java to be installed to work. I recommend having the latest 32-bit and 64-bit versions installed (unless you've got a 32-bit PC). Java can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
- Valid Minecraft Account(s). To download the game and any needed libraries, you will be asked to sign into MultiMC with a valid Minecraft account. For schools (and other businesses), you must legally own an account per device the game is running on. I will never support hacked or unlicensed clients.
- Internet Connection. For MultiMC to authenticate and for Mod Playground to download/update any mods, you need an Internet Connection. The faster the better!
